if userA is following userB then in the user scema of userB 
i will have a follow feild which is an array consisting the id of people whoe follow userB (ie id of userA)
similarly there will be another feild following which consists of id of user's that userB follows

the above method is not recomended bc when you hav millions of users and 1000's of followers and following it
will become difficult to navigate and find and update or delete from these arrays also we will have to update 
whole array by shifting the elements


to solve that issue we can create a follow collection which has 2 fields followersUserId and followingUserId 
and for every follow we will create a new entry in the feild with the above 2
